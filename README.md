# Oratory1990 Equalizer presets in Equalizer APO format.

Reddit user 'oratory1990' has published a remarkable collection of equalizer presets for headphones. The list includes hundreds of models, over various brands and types.

Unfortunately they are only availiable in PDF format which is notoriusly hard to parse.

This project lists every preset converted to the text format used in Equalizer APO (Windows) and PulseEffects (Linux).



### Caveats

- No code published yet, will be pushed in the future.

- Some PDF presets consist of multiple pages. In that case my script discared any page other than the first.
